## Mini Project — Palindrome Checker

**Objective:** Combine variables, string operations, and conditionals into one small program.

**Task:**
- Ask the user to enter a word or phrase.

**Expected Output:**
```
Enter a word or phrase: Racecar
Racecar is a palindrome!
```
```
Enter a word or phrase: Python
Python is not a palindrome.
```

**Hint:** You can reverse a string with slicing: `text[::-1]`. No loops or functions are required — a single `if-else` check is enough.
